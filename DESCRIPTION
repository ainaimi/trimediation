Description: Social epidemiologists often seek to determine the mechanisms that 
    underlie health disparities. This work is typically based on mediation 
    procedures that may not be justified with exposures of common interest in 
    social epidemiology. This tool allows us to explore the consequences of using 
    standard approaches, referred to as the difference and generalized product 
    methods, when mediator-outcome confounders are associated with the exposure.
    Available models are:
        1) The inverse probability-weighted marginal structural models, 
        2) The structural transformation method,
        3) The doubly robust g-estimation of a structural nested model, and 
        4) The doubly robust targeted minimum loss-based estimation. 
    This allows the user to explore ways in which a Standard approach for 
    mediation analysis can yield misleading results. For more information,
